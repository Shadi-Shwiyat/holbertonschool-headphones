## Implement a design from scratch
In this project we are implementing a design into a web page from scratch using CSS and HTML5. This is an iteration on a previous project where we were tasked with implementing a web page but we were given the HTML skeleton and guidance on the CSS. This time we are only given a figma file that will be the end result of our web page, and we are building everything on our own. We are also tasked with making the page compatible with mobile devices.

## Task
0. Read and be familiar with Figma
    Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.
    If you can’t access to it, please find here the Figma file
    Important notes with Figma:
    - if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
    - some values are in float - feel free to round them

    For this task, please write an amazing README.md

    Interactions note:
    - the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
    - links hover/active: #FF6565
    - button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
    - max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
